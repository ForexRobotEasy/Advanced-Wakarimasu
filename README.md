## Introduction
The Advanced Wakarimasu Expert Advisor is designed to trade multiple currency pairs based on the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and ATR (Average True Range) indicators. It executes trades when specific trade conditions are met, aiming to capture potential market reversals.

## Code Overview
The code consists of three main sections: Expert Advisor Initialization, Expert Advisor Execution, and Expert Advisor Deinitialization. Here's a brief explanation of each section:

### Expert Advisor Initialization
In the `OnInit()` function, the RSI and ATR indicators are initialized using the `Create()` method. Trade parameters such as the expert magic number and deviation for trade execution are set using the `SetExpertMagicNumber()` and `SetDeviationInPoints()` methods, respectively.

### Expert Advisor Execution
The `OnTick()` function is responsible for the execution of trades. It first checks if it is within the specified trading time range. Then, it loops through the target currency pairs defined by `MAX_SYMBOLS`. For each currency pair, it calculates the RSI and ATR values using the `iRSI()` and `iATR()` methods, respectively.

Based on the calculated values, the EA checks for trade conditions. If the RSI value is above 70 and the ATR value is greater than 0.001, a sell trade is opened using the `Sell()` method. If the RSI value is below 30 and the ATR value is greater than 0.001, a buy trade is opened using the `Buy()` method. The equity stop level is set using the `SetStopLoss()` method.

### Expert Advisor Deinitialization
The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the EA is being deinitialized. It destroys the RSI and ATR indicators using the `Destroy()` method.
